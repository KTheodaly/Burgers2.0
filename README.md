# Burgers2.0

## Node, Express, Handlebars

### What is this repo?

* A burger logger with MySQL, Node, Express, Handlebars and a homemade ORM (yum!)-- Node and MySQL to query and route data in the app, and Handlebars to generate HTML.

* It is also deployed to Heroku: https://bigbadburgerz.herokuapp.com/

### How does it work?

* Users input the names of burgers they'd like to eat.

* Whenever a user submits a burger's name, the app will display the burger on the left side of the page -- waiting to be devoured.

* Each burger in the waiting area also has a `Devour it!` button. When the user clicks it, the burger will move to the right side of the page.

* The app will store every burger in a database, whether devoured or not.


### Who will use it?

* The app is for course work using Node, Express, and Handlebars in an application, but anyone is welcome to look at the code.
